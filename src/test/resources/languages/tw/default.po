The higher the rating of a photographer who liked the photo, the more rating the like adds to the photo. Photos and series with the biggest number of likes are awarded the Best of the Week flag. Rating gradually decreases, and the yellow flag may disappear over time. The higher was the rating of a photo or a series, the longer it keeps the yellow flag."
msgstr "照片的評等取決於按讚數。不過，並不是所有按讚數都同樣有效。對照片按讚的攝影師評等愈高，該讚數加入照片的評等就愈多。按讚數最多的照片和系列將被賦予「本週最佳」的標章。評等會逐漸下降，黃色的標章將隨時間推移而消失。照片或系列的評等愈高，黃色標章的保留時間就愈長。"

#: application/views/scripts/rules/index.phtml:36
#, php-format
msgid "In general, a photographers' rating in each category consists of the rating of their %1$s best photos and %2$s best series in the category. The fresher the photo or the series, the more rating it adds to the photographer's rating. Photos and series with the Editors' Choice flag, and achievements in the MyWed Award annual contests contribute to the rating as well. Rating in each category is calculated separately. It means that a photographer's rating in the Wedding category does not influence their rating in the Kids category. Besides, the number of followers adds points to the photographer's rating, too."
msgstr "通常來說，攝影師在每個類別中的評等源於其%1$s張最佳照片以及%2$s組最佳系列。照片或系列愈新，加入攝影師的評等就愈多。具備「編輯精選」標章的照片和系列，以及獲得MyWed Award年度競賽獎項也對評等有所幫助。每個類別的評等都是分開計算的。這代表攝影師在婚禮類別的評等並不會影響其在兒童類別的評等。另外，粉絲數也能為攝影師評等加分。"

In brief, if you do anything on the website to get more rating instead of just having pleasure, please don't."
msgstr "任何呼籲對照片或個人檔案按讚或瀏覽的明示或暗示都將視為欺瞞評等系統。舉例來說，這包括「嘿，好照片！剛為他們評分！」等等的留言或訊息。此外，如果您只出於互讚的目的而對照片按讚，我們也將此視為欺瞞評等系統。簡而言之，除了獲得樂趣，如果您想在網站上進行任何獲取更多評等的動作，請不要這麼做。"
