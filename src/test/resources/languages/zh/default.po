However, major technical hurdles had to be surmounted in developing the mirror box and pentaprism mechanism, such as the need to switch the optical axes of photograph and viewfinder systems at high speed with a mirror."

Such a camera would have to withstand heavy shock and the extremely low polar temperatures.<br><br>Nikon's work resulted in the world's first titanium-exterior SLR camera in December 1977, called the Nikon F2 Titanium Uemura Special. The following year, Uemura headed across Greenland on his solo dog sled trek toward the North Pole with two cameras, and shot 180 rolls of film of the six month adventure."

"Of course, it will not be like that forever. We are certain that in some months the world will return to its routine course. However, we understand that not all of you can wait so long. Besides, we can't guarantee a second pandemic wave won’t occur, and weddings might remain prohibited for some time. In any case a diversification seems a good idea.\n\n"
"So we have decided to go for radical changes to let the website cover other topics: kids, family, portrait photography, vacation and travel photo shoots.\n\n"
"If you already work in these fields, you can now create a relevant portfolio on MyWed. If not, maybe it's the right time to try, as a talented person is talented in everything : )"
